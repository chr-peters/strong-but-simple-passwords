        This is a guide to creating strong passwords that are easy to remember.
        You start with a sentence of your choice and only keep the first letters of each word.
        After throwing in a symbol in between two random words, you have successfully created a secure password.

            How to create a secure and easy to remember password following some simple rules:
        </h1>

        <h3>1. Start with a sentence you can remember</h3>

        <form id="sentence_form" action="{{ url_for('index') }}" method="POST">
            <input type="text" id="input_sentence" name="input_sentence" value="{{ sentence }}">
        </form>

        <h3>2. Only keep the first 3 letters of each word</h3>

        <h3>3. Put a random symbol somewhere in between</h3>

        <button form="sentence_form" type="submit">Generate password!</button>

        {% if generated_password is defined %}

        {% if password_strength_response.get_slow_cracking_time_seconds() is le (60 * 60 * 24 * 2) %}

        <p>
            <strong>You are on the right track,</strong>
            but you might want to consider adding more words to your sentence.
            A hacker who can try <strong>10,000</strong> passwords per second (which really isn't alot)
            can find yours in
            <strong>{{ password_strength_response.get_slow_cracking_time_string() }}</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways, here is the password you generated:
            <input type="text" value="{{ generated_password }}">
        </p>

        {% else %}

        <p>
            <strong>Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰</strong><br>
            You successfully generated a secure password:
            <input type="text" value="{{ generated_password }}">
        </p>
        <p>
            If a hacker tried <strong>10,000</strong> different passwords every second,
            this is how long it would take them to find yours:
            <strong>{{ password_strength_response.get_slow_cracking_time_string() }}</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            {% if password_strength_response.get_fast_cracking_time_seconds() is le (60 * 60 * 24 * 2) %}

            <strong>But be careful!</strong> There are password crackers out there with alot of
            computing power.
            If they can try <strong>10,000,000,000</strong> passwords per second, they can still find
            your password in
            <strong>{{ password_strength_response.get_fast_cracking_time_string() }}</strong>.
            <br>
            So maybe consider adding more words to your sentence!

            {% else %}

            Even if they had a big GPU cluster running <strong>10,000,000,000</strong> passwords
            per second, they would still need
            <strong>{{ password_strength_response.get_fast_cracking_time_string() }}</strong>
            to crack your password.

            {% endif %}
